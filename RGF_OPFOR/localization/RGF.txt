@RGF_Smoke_desc=Russia's standard RGD-2 pattern of smoke grenade, lighter weight and longer lasting but in a smaller radius than the US equivalent. \n\nCan be used to effectively screen troop movements and provide concealment\n\nFuse Time: Instant\nEffective Range: 3m\nBurn Time: 20s
@RGF_RGD_desc=This Russian model RGD-5 has a painfully long fuse but also offers superb lethality in a large radius, good for blasting large groups of enemies with insufficient time to react.\n\nFuse Time: 2s\nLethal Range: 3m\nInjury Range: 8m
@RGF_RGN_desc=The latest offensive grenade to be adopted by Russian forces, the RGN has a secondary impact fuse to ensure reliable detonation and high lethality when properly aimed, but the effectiveness against targets further away is likewise reduced.\n\nFuse Time: Impact\nLethal Range: 1.5m\nInjury Range: 3m
@RGF_Stun_desc=This Russian Zarya-3 stun grenade brings aspects of both the stinger and flashbang by combining a flash charge to create a blinding light with a significant amount of small plastic projectiles.\n\nFuse Time: 0.5s\nInjury Range: 1m\nStun Range: 4m
@armor_6B45_desc=The Ratnik combat system Class 5 vest is capable of competently defending against modern rifle threats across the entire torso and includes integrated neck protection, offering slightly better coverage than it's American competition but also being a little heavier.\n\nOffers minimal resistance to dedicated armor piercing threats and has only light kevlar protecting the sides.
@armor_6B43_desc=Extra heavy Class 6A armor covering a significant part of the upper torso in protection from even AP rifle threats through a vest, arm guards, groin flap, and neck guard for absolutely unrivaled protection at the cost of weight and bulk.\n\nNote this protection does not extend to the sides or rear, which are no stronger than a standard 6B45 vest.
@armor_6B46_desc=Designed around the idea of a lightweight plate carrier with front and rear pockets for Class 5 armor inserts, commonly issued to vehicle crewmen and airborne units as it offers good protection for the weight and with minimal excess bulk to get in your way.\n\nBear in mind however that the sides are protected by nothing but some military grade string.
@RGF_demo_desc=A two pack of standardized SZ-1 demolition charges meant for the destruction of hardened positions and other combat engineering tasks, quite effective against typical building walls if collateral isn't the kind of thing that will keep you up tonight.\n\nPlacement Time: 4.5s\nLethal Range: 4m\nInjury Range: 7m
@RGF_doorcharge_desc=Prepacked explosive charges meant to send a door hurtling off it's hinges while only slightly threatening the lives of the hostages that may or may not be inside, lightweight and easily mounted with a quick strip of tape.\n\nPlacement Time: 3s\nLethal Range: 3m\nInjury Range: 5m
@helmet_6B27_desc=Basic model of combat helmet with effective coverage and protection from common battlefield hazards like shrapnel and fragmentation, does nothing to direct impacts from rifle cartridges but might bounce a pistol bullet if you're lucky.
@helmet_6B47_desc=While protection from the 6B27 in unchanged this improved style helmet is much lighter and substantially more comfortable for prolonged use, factor in the mounting bracket for nightvision and you can finally bring your platoon to the 21st century.\n\nWell, ok, maybe late 90s, but still pretty good.
@hat_VKBO_desc=A simple fabric field cap to keep your head protected from the sun and rain, practically weightless and easy to wear, it also does absolutely nothing whatsoever to stop random objects entering your brain.\n\nSnazzy as hell though, and do you really want to wear that stuffy helmet?
@firearm_RPG26RGF_desc=Standard issue for most Russian forces the RPG-26 is a lightweight disposable launcher with a single piece unibody design, firing a 72.5mm rocket at ranges exceeding 200m it is a versatile and effective anti-structure and anti-tank weapon system.\n\nDeploy Time: 3s\nLethal Range: 2m
@firearm_RPG7HEATRGF_desc=The venerable RPG-7, a classic reusable launcher that's been serving reliably for over 60 years, it may not be the fastest or the most accurate but it won't let you down.\n\nDeploy Time: 3s\nLethal Range: 3m
@firearm_AKMRGF_desc=A retro AKM that's probably about as old as your ration packs, not exactly the highest speed rifle around but isn't without advantages even today, for one it suppresses quieter than later 5.45 guns, and when you run out of ammo it makes a much better club.
@firearm_AKMRGFGL_desc=A retro AKM that's probably about as old as your ration packs, not exactly the highest speed rifle around but isn't without advantages even today, for one it suppresses quieter than later 5.45 guns, and when you run out of ammo it makes a much better club.\n\nThis variant has a mounted GP-34.
@firearm_AKMsupRGF_desc=Suppressed AKMs can be surprisingly quiet with little loss in lethality even when transitioning to subsonic ammunition, though suppressing a full sized AK with a fixed stock doesn't leave as much room to maneuver as one would like.\n\nSound Range Subsonic: 6m\nSound Range Supersonic: 36m
@ammo_762x39_FMJ_231_RGF_desc=Standard 57-N-231 jacketed ball ammo features a combination lead and soft steel core that gives good energy retention, though it's still no match for body armor, and isn't prone to reliable expansion or fragmentation.
@ammo_762x39_AP_7N23_RGF_desc=A recent upgrade to the old 57-N-231 that replaces the soft hybrid core with a proper hardened steel penetrator capable of piercing armor at moderate combat ranges, lethality is also slightly improved due to more consistent ballistic performance.
@ammo_762x39_Sub_231U_RGF_desc=A subsonic variant of typical 57-N-231 that upgrades to a much heavier 192gr bullet, runs very quiet suppressed when you need to be sneaky, but it also has a small drop in lethality and very poor performance against armor at anything but short range.
@firearm_AK74RGF_desc=Standard issue since the late 70s, the AK-74 makes use of newer 5.45x39 ammunition designed to increase lethality while reducing weight, an all around competent upgrade to the classic platform for most battlefield tasks.
@ammo_545x39_FMJ_7N10_RGF_desc=Basic 7N10 is a jacketed fragmenting round with a semi-hardened steel core, somewhat lacking in terminal effect but with moderate recoil and a flat trajectory shot placement is significantly easier.
@ammo_545x39_FMJ_7N22_RGF_desc=Upgraded steel core round with consistent fragmentation and good terminal ballistics from both standard and shorter barrels.
@firearm_AK74RGFGL_desc=Standard issue since the late 70s, the AK-74 makes use of newer 5.45x39 ammunition designed to increase lethality while reducing weight, an all around competent upgrade to the classic platform for most battlefield tasks.\n\nThis variant has a mounted GP-34.
@firearm_aks74u_RGF_desc=An ultra compact AK-74 for special forces, vehicle crews, and officers. Very light and handy for anyone needing to move unencumbered but with poor terminal performance from it's short barrel.
@firearm_aks74USD_RGF_desc=With the suppressed AKS-74UB you can make effective use of subsonic ammo for the
@firearm_PKM_RGF_desc=The PKM is a modernization of a venerable Soviet belt-fed in service since the 60s, capable of laying down heavy fire both from a fixed position and off the shoulder as needed make it a valued part of any squad.
@ammo_762R57N323RGF_desc=Simple steel cored ammo from the old days, lacking the frills of current service cartridges but a large caliber bullet getting slung with a full power charge is hard to argue with when it comes flying your way.
@firearm_RPK_RGF_desc=An old Soviet autorifle based around the AKM, large and bulky but still light by MG standards when you're in the market for some 7.62x39 fire support for the team. Big drums are faster to reload then a belt while still being large enough to lay down some heavy fire.
@firearm_RPKSup_RGF_desc=Suppressing an RPK might not be the most obvious choice given it's already substantial length, but the ability to take AKM suppressors already in the inventory means options are limited.\n\nSound Range Subsonic: 6m\nSound Range Supersonic: 36m
@firearm_RPK74_RGF_desc=The 5.45 alternative to the RPK is both lighter and handier letting it perform tasks more suited to an assault rifle than a machinegun.\n\nIt's still pretty hefty though regardless.
@firearm_SVD_RGF_desc=One of the first purpose built squad marksmen rifles to see service, the SVD has been a reliable performer for accurately taking out targets beyond normal combat ranges.\n\nGreat for it's designed role but still not a true sniper's rifle.
@ammo_762R7N1_RGF_desc=Match grade 7N1 ammunition meant to be used in high-accuracy applications, featuring consistent burning extruded propellent and a precision manufactured projectile with good terminal effect.
@firearm_RPOZ_RGF_desc=A single use incendiary launcher for assaulting infantry in entrenched positions, the explosive payload is undersized relative to the total volume of the warhead but the incendiary component more than makes up for it.\n\nDeploy Time: 3s\nInjury Range: 4m
@firearm_RPOM_RGF_desc=This modernized RPO-Z is now reusable with multiple shots, overall performance is largely unchanged though the ability to carry several rockets makes it significantly more versatile in an operation.\n\nDeploy Time: 3s\nInjury Range: 4m
@firearm_VSSM_RGF_desc=The latest version of the VSS Vintorez marksman carbine rolled out with the Ratnik program is meant to provide silent and versatile firepower at both short and long range as needed, though it lags behind dedicated platforms in both areas.\n\nSound Range: 4m
@firearm_ASM_RGF_desc=A modified AS Val carbine intended for larger scale production, officially rolled out to standard infantry as part of the Ratnik program it features rail and optic mounts for modern weapon accessories to improve effectiveness, particularly in stealth scenarios.\n\nSound Range: 4m
@ammo_939FMJ7N9_desc=Light armor piercing rounds in 9x39 lose some lethality at close range but retain better performance as ranges increase, can also pierce IIIA soft armor.
@ammo_939FMJ7N8_desc=Typical subsonic 7N8 ammunition is a lethal and accurate cartridge when noise is a concern, though it's performance against armor is almost non-existent.
@ammo_762R57N13RGF_desc=Enhanced performance steel core 7.62x54r meant to both increase lethality and penetrate armor.
@ammo_7N16_desc=Enhanced lethality flat-nosed ammo with a higher pressure spec, the improved projectile design and added velocity make it a suitably deadly round without increasing recoil.
@ammo_7N21_desc=High powered +P+ 9mm with a steel penetrator, deadly against soft armor at short distances and with strong terminal effect at every range.
@ammo_57N181_desc=Old Soviet era 9x18 ammo, nothing but a round piece of steel shot flying out the barrel at high speed, extremely simplistic but deadly against unarmored personnel at close range.
@firearm_grach_desc=The MP-443 Grach was purpose built to fire extreme overpressure ammunition while still being light and comfortable, with 17 rounds of overspec ammo on tap in a gun with surprisingly modest recoil it's no wonder it's found adoption by every branch.
@firearm_PM_pistol_desc=The world famous Makarov makes for a compact yet effective handgun, easy to point and shoot but it's archaic controls can make it a bit difficult to work, the 8 round mags of a weaker 9mm also don't help.\n\nStill it's extremely fast on the draw.
@nvg_RGF_1PN138_desc=Rolled out to Russian troops with the Ratnik program the 1PN138 is a night vision monocular meant to aid in target acquisition and accuracy during low light conditions, offering limited FOV due to it's single tube construction it is however fairly lightweight.
@scope_pkasRGF_desc=Standard red dot optic for AK styled rifles, features good close combat performance but still retains an edge at longer distances too.
@scope_kobraRGF_desc=Ultra low profile open styled sight, gives excellent awareness and speed at short range but becomes more difficult to acquire a target the farther out it gets.
@scope_KashtanRGF_desc=One of the newest combat optics to be issued, the Kashtan has a fixed low magnification that enables effective use at every distance, though it is a little too much for those extreme close up shots.
@scope_pso1m2RGF_desc=The classic SVD optic with an adjusted bullet drop compensator for AK rifles, a solid choice when you want your riflemen to make those longer distance shots without terribly compromising their shooting close-in.
@scope_po35RGF_desc=A heavy medium range optic with a large field of view, ideally suited to machineguns or marksman rifles.
@scope_pso1RGF_desc=The go-to optic on SVD rifles, good at range but can still take a shot close up in a pinch.
@scope_pso39RGF_desc=The longest range optic available at a squad level, lets your marksman really do some showing off without negatively affected performance at shorter distances.
@ammo_762R7BZ3_RGF_desc=Armor piercing incendiary ammunition provides a devastating wound cavity and effectively negates the majority of body armor, though the flight path isn't quite as consistent as match grade ammo.
@firearm_SVDM_RGF_desc=A modernized and upgraded SVD, featuring polymer furniture, a folding stock and suppressor mount it's an all around faster and lighter rifle with no compromises made.
@firearm_SVDMsup_RGF_desc=With suppressor installed the SVDM gains back most of the weight lost with the new furniture and becomes a bit front heavy to boot, though even still it's a pretty comfortable and portable rifle.\n\nSound Range: 48m
@firearm_AK74MRRGF_desc=The AK-74's final form is a very modern and ergonomic gun with the recoil of the 5.45 almost completely tamed. Fires fast and recovers quick when you're looking to move fast and stack bodies.\n\nAlso you can try to pretend that you're actually American SEALs.
@firearm_AK74MRsupRGF_desc=Slap a can on that kitted up AK-74 when you want to be a little quieter than usual without the sacrifices associated with subsonic cartridges.\n\nSound Range: 36m
@firearm_RPG7tandemRGF_desc=Loading up the RPG-7 with the much more modern and improved PG-7VR allows it to punch through walls with full lethality to room occupants.\n\nIt was meant to take out modern MBTs with reactive armor, but I'm sure it's fine to do this too.\n\nDeploy Time: 3s\nLethal Range: 3m
